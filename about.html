        <div><p>An eternal student, a chronic overthinker, in a hurry to dip my toes in diverse pools of human experience 
            from music and dance to design and technology. 
            Happy to be making connections with people from all walks of life and getting inspired by your work. 
            Here I hope to share bits of my journey and comment on salient issues. I do bookkeeping for a living, but I 
            believe in synergy between art and science, design and music, nature and technology. Time permitting, I hope
            to put my passion to work for the benefit of humanity.   
            Ready to collaborate on projects involving education, design, technology, language learning, and research.
