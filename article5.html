<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature, meaning, purpose, and status of literature today</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Art is what makes life more interesting than art.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â€• Robert Filliou</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the purpose and nature of contemporary literature is akin to trying to discern the meaning of life. The meaning of literature is hard to condense because like life, like history, like reality, like the world and like the universe, literature is so multifaceted that it manages to satisfy any definition and fit within any theory. Its scope is vast. Depending on the content and purpose it can be philosophical, psychological, historical, aesthetic, social, political, emotional, romantic, existential and any combination of the above. It can produce a myriad of effects and serve many a purpose. Literature can be entertainment, relaxation, an escape, a mental stimulation, a source of knowledge, a catalyst for growth, and a way to relate to the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature is a multiverse. It is an alternative dimension at the intersection of the world and the mind, the external and the internal, the material and the ideal. Literature is an alchemy of realities, experiences, lives, thoughts, ideas, emotions. It&rsquo;s a universal kitchen where any dish of any flavor is possible, from exotic sophisticated concoctions for the most refined palate to the simplest basics. It can be peppered with jokes, dipped in sarcasm, soaked in irony, permeated with mystery, wrapped in fantasy, marinated in suspense, sprinkled with metaphors and allegories, saturated with insights and revelations. Or it can be raw, real, simple. Literature is like a world market where you can get any taste and flavor: spices to sharpen your senses, sweets to make you happy, meats and bread to nourish you, spirits to excite you, milk to calm you, or coffee to keep you awake all night. Fast food or exotic delicacies, bland or flavorful, complex, or basic, literature will feed your mind and heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature is &ldquo;light-rature&rdquo;. It is like an infinite color spectrum, the literary light emitting &ldquo;electropoetic&rdquo; waves of various frequencies that produce different effects: warm infrared novels that let you see in the dark, &ldquo;noir&rdquo; X-ray novels, penetrating your bones, entertaining informative radio-wave novels, destructive ultraviolet novels, harmless practical microwave novels...&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Plato&rsquo;s Pharmakon, literature is a poison and a cure. It is a tree that grows every possible fruit - sour, sweet, salty, bitter. Like an unrequited adolescent love, it can break your heart but also make you grow. Like music, literature is an exercise of emotion. It makes us understand things by feeling them and feel things by understanding them. It can turn emotional baggage into emotional capital, teach us to be more emotionally intelligent. It lets us indirectly experience other ways of being. In this way, it is an extension of life. It gives one the opportunity to live many lives by seeing the world with someone else&rsquo;s eyes. Having absorbed the new experience, with each book you reincarnate as a new being. With each book, you grow a new &ldquo;third eye&rdquo;, as you experience some alternative truths.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But literature can be a double-edged sword. Carrying extra lives can be a burden. The curse of literature is that it can make one hyper-sensitive. Like acting using the Stanislavski method, reading, identifying yourself with another, can leave you vulnerable. Charlotte Gilman, Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, romantic poets, existentialists were a little haunted and so are we, their readers. Literature, especially the close reading method, intensifies emotions and makes you think things over and feel things over, making it hard not to overthink or &ldquo;overfeel&rdquo;. A book may leave you with a mixed feeling of emptiness and fulfillment at the same time. Reading may be a bitter pill, and like diving from a cliff, it requires taking risks. A strong piece of fiction is always like expulsion from paradise. It may be painful, but you don&rsquo;t regret eating the apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature doesn&rsquo;t always wear its goal on its sleeve. But depending on the intention of the writer and the needs of the reader, it can produce multiple effects. It can instruct or delight, most likely both, because delightful instruction and instructive delight are a better bargain than if they were separate. In her thirst for literature, a reader can pursue an aesthetic or a pragmatic goal. She might want to learn or she might want to enjoy, most likely both. Just like in life we need food for the body and food for the soul, in literature, we need books that feed both our curiosity and intellect as well as move us on the emotional level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trick, the kick, the addictive power of literature is in the sublime experience that it can produce. It is this state when you get the goosebumps from knowing something unknowable. Like Kant&rsquo;s indeterminate concept, this unformulated knowing, makes you understand something, which is in fact more feeling that knowing. It is a visceral and mental experience that makes your heart skip a bit. Like the &ldquo;something&rdquo; we all felt reading &ldquo;The Catcher in the Rye&rdquo;. It is this organic unity of form and content, the objective correlative, the congruence of stylistic elements, the convergence of language, plot, form, and meaning that drive you to a cathartic experience and makes you feel the &ldquo;FEELING&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the author intends it or not, literature cannot avoid miming. It reflects the world we live in, the society, its structure, its complexities, and anxieties. Literature gives answers, but it poses even more questions. It likes rhetorical questions and ellipses&hellip;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nabokov playfully defined &ldquo;ellipsis&rdquo; as the &ldquo;footprints of words that tiptoed away&rdquo;. It was through his prose that I experienced the aesthetic pleasure of form. His words smell, laugh, sparkle, and ring. They have texture, they can be fluffy or rigid, steel-cold, or sizzling hot. It&rsquo;s a lesson in synesthesia. Writers like Murakami, Kundera, Raymond Carver, Easton Ellis, Sherman Alexie, Iris Murdoch are more concerned with our human experience and interactions as we move through time and space. In an unimposing, non-didactic way, they offer a balanced description of our everyday life filled with banalities, ironies, but also psychological insights. Perhaps even didactic literature doesn't have to be disgusting when it is presented in an elegant way and doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be philosophical beyond its own means. Bradbury's &ldquo;Fahrenheit 451&rdquo;, Kurt Vonnegut&rsquo;s &ldquo;Breakfast of Champions&rdquo; alarm us to the dangers of our greedy civilization without imposing their own ideology. Sometimes the deepest lessons come from stories told with ease and simplicity, like &ldquo;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&rdquo; by Mark Haddon or &ldquo;A Thousand Splendid Suns&rdquo; by Khaled Hosseini.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the age of mass media and information technology, the definition of literature is getting stretched to the new dimensions. In its wider sense, literature may include many types of narrative mediated via various forms of media. Films are based on a screenplay, which often comes from a work of fiction. Thus, in the cinema, we see a fusion of media. It is literature in 2D, in color and sound. So perhaps film can be viewed as a XXI century reincarnation of literature. By the same token, audiobooks offer a new way to &ldquo;read&rdquo; in the busy world. Other emerging forms of writing like blogging and online journalism fight for the right to be included within the literary domain. Some people go as far as to claim literariness of tweets. Our generations are witnessing literature mutating, migrating from media to media. At the same time, traditional paper books are alive and kicking, offering their particular, quiet, solitary, intimate experience to readers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading fiction stirs up our minds. Each minute we are getting older and the older we get, the more acutely we feel our physical decline. As our body ages, so does our brain, yet, unless we develop a mental illness, our mind can grow. Mental activity helps us beat the race with time. As we are inching back to the nothingness from which we came from via birth, we strive to feed our curiosity, understand, and learn. This feeling of understanding can induce pleasure as a side effect. We want the world to make sense to us and ourselves make sense to us. In comes literature as a mediator that facilitates our growth and understanding of our own nature, our fellow humans, and the world we share. There are many ways to know the world and our place in it, literature provides one path. Indirectly it leads us to greater self-awareness, understanding of ourselves, and our place within the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
