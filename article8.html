<h1>Mimesis, performativity, and sophism in Trump's 2019 State of the Union Address</h1>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s address is a cunning performance and an example of a political theatre full of drama. It could have been a fine piece of comedy, were it not in fact a tragedy, a play founded on human misery, immoral judgment, business trickery, and political deceit.</p>
<p>A showman and a fabricator, Trump is famous for making absurd look normal. In his attempt at mimesis, Trump imposes his warped worldview on the gullible audience. In the tradition of Gorgias, Trump uses rhetorical methods in his sophistic speech in order to manipulate and distort reality, make himself look benevolent, and defend his policies.</p>
<p>Words can be powerful tools, especially when uttered by someone in the position of authority. Trump exploits the performativity of speech to convince the audience of his righteousness and promote his agenda. Like a banker pushing an adjustable-rate mortgage, Trump uses his marketing skills to sell his idea of America. He tries to make the dystopian reality look like a utopian paradise.</p>
<p>Horace emphasizes the importance of being sensitive to the needs of the audience and choosing speech accordingly. Politicians and their speechwriters like no one else understand this strategy and use it to gain political capital and appeal to their target audiences across social, economic, and ideological backgrounds. Likewise, Trump views the audience as a target market. To him, the public is a number, a percent in statistics, a mindless mass that needs to be wooed. Consequently, Trump varies the themes of his speech to target each sector of his constituents. A</p>
<p> crafty marketeer able to sell anything to anyone, he pushes his political agenda onto his listeners using his distorted rhetoric to please everyone whose vote matters. A seasoned businessman, Trump knows how to use empty rhetoric to make the right impression on his constituents. He serves each target audience what they want to hear: the anti-abortion laws to the evangelicals, a paid family leave to the working mothers, military propaganda to patriots sugarcoating everything with loud accolades of his achievements.</p>
<p>In a sense, Trump is an author, because he talks fiction. But his fiction is of a different kind: it is self-serving. Trump uses it to fabricate a biased narrative, disguising his true motives, justifying his own actions, and feeding the audiences what they want to hear. Unlike literary writers, he does it in order to promote his agenda and ridicule his opponents. It is meant to mislead and validate the righteousness of his regime. Trump is trying to appeal not only to the minds but to the hearts, using poetic-ish lines to induce a sentiment in the audience and entice them into believing him. He uses the literary device of repetition:</p>
<p>&ldquo;...You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Trump&rsquo;s verse is what happens when you &ldquo;dip&rdquo; a limerick into romanticism. Attempting to sound noble and aspirational, Trump&rsquo;s verse has the effect of cheap sentimental versification which might be well suited for the idle minds of socially conservative public brainwashed by the mainstream news, isolated from the world and its real problems, deprived of independent opinion and impartial analysis. With his lyricism, Trump strives to move the audience, not unlike Sydney with his architectonic purpose of literature.</p>
<p>Rhetoric and discourse are powerful tools that are truly able to move people&rsquo;s hearts and minds. Plato warned that in the hands of crooks these tools can corrupt and mislead. Although Plato focused unnecessarily on the didactic purpose of arts, he was right about the potential dangers of rhetoric when it ends up in the wrong hands (or mouths). Our goal as an audience is to be vigilant, perspicacious, and sensitive to the tricks played by the politicians.</p>
