<h1>Structural violence and Anthropocene inequality on the Marshall Islands.</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--<p>Between 1948 and 1958, the U.S. military detonated 43 atomic bombs here. After agreeing to a 1958 temporary moratorium on nuclear testing with the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, the U.S. began using the atoll as a conventional and bioweapons testing ground. For the next 18 years, the U.S. shot ballistic <a href="https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16365056.pdf">missiles at it from California</a>, tested virulent forms of bacteria on its islands, and <a href="https://marshallislands.llnl.gov/ccc/Hamilton_LLNL-TR-648143_final.pdf">detonated a series</a> of other large, conventional bombs in the lagoon.</p>-->
<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, between 1948 and 1958, The US used the Marshall Islands to conduct numerous atomic bombs tests in preparation for the possibility of a war with the Soviet Union (LA Times). After the tests, the US was also investigating the effects of nuclear waste on humans, tested virulent bacteria, and detonated other non-nuclear bombs. During this time, the US relocated local residents, disrupting their lives. After the tests were over, the US and the Marshall Islands made an agreement that required the US to build a dome to contain all the waste released from the detonations. The US was also required to pay compensation to the islands each year. After the tests instead of sending professional construction workers, the US sent soldiers to construct a dome. The soldiers were not aware they are working with dangerous waste. They worked in the heat without any protective equipment. Now the contract that the US signed is expiring and the payments are due to stop.</p>
<p>During the tests, the residents who lived close to the testing grounds had to relocate to other islands. This uprooted whole communities who lost their homes. Soon after the tests were done, locals started developing thyroid diseases, cancers, and other ailments. As the years go by, the rising tides are eroding the dome causing wase to leak out into the ocean. The Marshall Islands have sued the US for failing to create a protective structure which is the cause of health and environmental crisis. However, the US ignored the judgment of the independent arbiter called the Nuclear Claims Tribunal, finding a loophole in the contract. Thus, without any battlefield the Cold War waged by the US and the Soviet Union has created real victims who had zero interest and zero involvement in the conflict.</p>
<p>The experts sent by the US to investigate the situation dismiss the gravity of the problem. They say that before the dome started eroding there had been already so much nuclear waste in the water that the newly-released waste is literally a drop in the ocean and is insignificant. These experts also dismiss the danger of the radiation while people keep getting sick with thyroid and skin diseases including cancers.</p>
<p>As a result of the above conundrum, the Marshall Islands are dealing with a highly complex situation. It is a problem at the intersection of military, environmental, and legal issues and it requires a deep geographical and historical analysis. It is also a problem that was enabled by a particular ideology inspired by the discourse of the West and the Rest. It is an example of the creation of structural violence that has lead to health and environmental crises on the islands. As the tides erode the concrete on the surface of the dome, the nuclear waste is eroding the health of locals, causing deaths and destroying their lives. The waste is leaking into the oceans contaminating water, coral reefs, and animals causing biological extinctions.</p>
<p>In his essay &ldquo;An Anthropology of Structural Violence&rdquo;, Paul Farmer calls for examining &ldquo;the roles played by the erasure of historical memory and other forms of desocialization as enabling conditions of structures that are both &ldquo;sinful&rdquo; and ostensibly &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s fault&rdquo; (Farmer, p 307). The health and environmental disasters on the Marshall Islands are stark examples of such erasure of history. While ins-and-outs of the Cold War are part of the US school curricula, there is no mention of the nuclear tests on the Marshall Islands in history textbooks. At the same time the Chernobyl disaster&nbsp; - a tragedy caused by the enemy The Soviet Union - has been thoroughly covered and condemned in the news and is part of common knowledge of an average American. The viewers can gasp at the horrors of &ldquo;Chernobyl&rdquo; in the popular TV-show while people on the Marshall Islands keep dealing with the repercussions of the US nuclear tests that undermined their health, land, and ecosystem. The US selectively erases memories that harm its image, highlighting the favorable parts while hiding inconvenient truths. This way history gets erased.</p>
<p>In the above statement Farmer also points out that problems like this are portrayed as &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo; The United States has not accepted responsibility for the leakage and for the health crisis it is causing. The US managed to avoid this responsibility by cleverly using the legal system to its advantage. It claims that the contract did not require the US to construct a dome that protects residents from hazardous waste, but rather a structure that merely houses the waste. Even though the dome is being eroded by the tides, according to the US it still fulfils its function. Thus, the US has cleared itself from any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. This is an example of how one party can skillfully bend the legal system to make it an instrument of structural violence.</p>
<p>In the above quote, Farmer also mentions &ldquo;structures&rdquo; that create conditions enabling structural violence. He mostly means social structures, such as the unfair government and institutions. However, in the case of the Marshall Islands, the dome created by the US is literally such a structure, in concrete. Indeed, further Farmer focuses on the concept of &ldquo;materiality of the social&rdquo; (p. 308). He specifies that &ldquo;any social project requires construction material, while the building process is itself inevitably social and thus cultural.&rdquo; The poorly constructed dome - the material part - is the actual cause of the problem. It was planned and constructed by people from the US with a particular agenda and a particular relationship to the place - the social component. Further Farmer explains that &ldquo;the adverse outcomes associated with structural violence - death, injury, illness, subjugation, stigmatization, and even psychological terror - come to have their &ldquo;final common pathway&rdquo; in the material&rdquo; (p. 308). Poorly made, the dome leaks waste and exacerbates the already hazardous conditions on the islands causing more illness and death. Thus, the dome can serve an architectural metaphor of structural violence representing the indirect abuse of innocent people. The US is the &ldquo;architect&rdquo; of this violence.</p>
<p>The nuclear disaster set up by the US keeps affecting locals to this day. Farmer insists on examining the present-day life and conditions, in order to unearth &ldquo;the webs of living power that enmesh witnessed misery&rdquo; (p. 309). He explains how important it is to conduct a thorough anthropological inquiry and &ldquo;tally the body count&rdquo;. He points out that &ldquo;such inquiry seeks to understand how suffering is muted or elided altogether. It explores the complicity necessary to erase history and cover up the clear links between the dead and the near-dead and those who are the winners in the struggle for survival&rdquo; (p. 307). The Marshall Islands&rsquo; population is dealing with a handful of health issues, yet, no thorough study has been conducted. The experts sent by the US claim that the area is safe, even though the people continue getting sick.</p>
<p>In his essay Farmer proves the importance of analysis that is &ldquo; geographically broad and historically deep&rdquo;. He notes that &ldquo;erasure of history is subtle and incremental and depends upon the erasure of links across time and space&rdquo; (p. 308). Upon closer examination, it becomes obvious that the main cause of the Marshall Islands&rsquo; problems hides in the history of the Cold War. The links that the US has kept out of textbooks become apparent during a proper exam that includes historical, geographical, epidemiological, and demographic analysis.</p>
<p>On the environmental level, the crisis is a two-sided issue, with a complex cycle of causes and effects. The decaying leaking nuclear waste has created an environmental problem destroying marine ecosystems around the island. This is the direct effect of the poor management of nuclear waste by the US. Thus, the mismanagement of waste is causing an environmental crisis on the island.</p>
<p>In her essay &ldquo;Anthropocene fever&rdquo;, Jedadiah Purdy argues that &ldquo;natural catastrophes are the joint product of natural and human systems.&rdquo; The environmental crisis on the Marshall Islands is a salient case study. The dome is a human creation as is the waste that it contains. It is being eroded by the rising tides which represent the natural cause which is also the result of man-made climate change. If the waste and the dome were not there, the rising sea levels would not cause the death of the ecosystems surrounding the islands. Resonating with Mike Davis&rsquo; concept of &ldquo;unnatural disasters&rdquo;, Purdy explains that &ldquo;your vulnerability to disaster is often a direct expression of your standing in a political and economic) order.&rdquo; Indeed, the Islands do not have the resources to create a more efficient protective structure or deal with the consequences. Nor can they afford to create defense structures that would protect them from floods.</p>
<p>In addition to the nuclear waste spill, global climate change is causing the warming of the waters around the Islands, creating an unlivable environment for the marine animals and destroying the coral reefs. Moreover, the sea levels are rising, so tides reach the dome covering the nuclear waste, The concrete cracks releasing more waste into the ocean. Thus, a small country that barely creates any emissions is suffering from the environmental problems to which the US is a major contributor. The Marshall Islands have very little responsibility but a very high vulnerability to global climate change.</p>
<p>In her essay, Purdy talks about Anthropocene inequality. She notes that &ldquo;where previous episodes of global ecological inequality took place under direct imperial administration&hellip; ours is emerging under the sign of free contract.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, the Marshall Islands voluntarily entered into a contract that permitted the US onto its territory. However, the US used the legal system to mislead the Marshall Island about the safety of the US endeavors.</p>
<p>On the legal level, the problem reveals the uneven legal power distribution between different state actors. Marshall Islands sued the US for not properly taking care of the dome and causing hazardous waste release into the water which in turn causes health and environmental crises on the islands. The Marshall Islands won the case in the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. The islands were awarded&nbsp; $2 billion in compensation. However, the US only paid $4 million. Moreover, the US explains that the contract in which the US agrees to build the dome to hold the waste does not require the dome to protect the residents from harm. According to the US, the contract only requires the dome to contain the waste. The Marshall Island government says they assumed that the protection was the reason for the dome&rsquo;s construction. But the US side replied that protecting the residents from nuclear waste was not in the contract. Thus, the way the contract was worded by the US created a legal loophole that released the US from responsibility.</p>
<p>What is happening to the Marshall Islands is part of discursive practice ignited by the belief in the divide between the Rest and the West. According to Stuart Hall, a discourse is &ldquo;a particular way of representing &ldquo;the West&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Rest&rdquo; and the relations between them. The way a discourse represents &ldquo;the Rest&rdquo; determines how others treat this group and how &ldquo;the West&rdquo; behaves towards it (Hall, p. 291). Although the US has never colonized the islands, the echoes of colonialist&nbsp;mentality&nbsp;echoes in the attitudes of US officials. According to the LA Times, the Marshall Islands are small and remote and were considered strategically unimportant. Barnett would perhaps call them part of &ldquo;the gap&rdquo; for their lack of connection to the global economy and finance. The population of the Islands is descendants of migrants from Asia and Polynesia who came to the islands by boat 3,000 years ago. The US hesitated to use the Islands for nuclear tests and studies of their consequences. But they went ahead with them. According to the Los Angeles Times, &ldquo;U.S. government documents from the time show that officials weighed the potential hazards of radiation exposure against &ldquo;the current low morale of the natives&rdquo; and a &ldquo;risk of onset of indolence.&rdquo; Trying to defend the islanders in 1956, the U.S. official Merrill Eisenbud offered a hyperbole, which revealed deep prejudice about non-Western cultures: &ldquo;while it is true that these people do not live the way that Westerners do, it is nonetheless also true that they are more like us than mice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The US never colonized the Islands but it nevertheless managed to exploit them. Choosing the Islands was not a coincidence but rather a result of careful consideration enabled by the discourse of the Rest and the West. A Vice article cites a nuclear historian Alex Welerstine who summarizes the irony in this tragedy: &rdquo;That somehow the world's richest nation can't seem to find the political will to make things right with a small, poor nation that sacrificed much in the name of American national security is a travesty. U.S. officials in the Cold War were quick to talk about how important the testing was to American survival, but somehow that importance never translated into sincere gratitude to the suffering Marshallese."</p>
