<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miranda as an enigma in Peter Weir's &ldquo;Picnic at Hanging Rock&rdquo;.</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his film, Peter Weir wisely uses the elements of mise-en-scene to create a compelling character that has become an archetype of an enigmatic woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the shot in front of the school, we see the heroine in focus at the eye-level. It is a medium close-up including the shoulders clad in a modest cotton dress, a delicate collar embroidered with flowers hugging the neck. Edith and the other student are slightly out of focus while the background of greenery and the white gap of the sky are fully out of focus. The even sunlight softly illuminates Miranda&rsquo;s face framed by ruffled curls. There are no shadows, except for the slight shade under the hat. The color scheme consists of greens, whites, beiges, with the accent on Miranda&rsquo;s lightly made-up face, the coral lips, and brilliant eyes. As Miranda looks up to make eye contact with Sarah, her expression changes and the minuscule details in her mimics indicate several possible emotions. Those feelings could be compassion towards Sarah and understanding akin to that of an older sister (frame 1). The demure half-smile (frame 2) may give away the pleasure of being the object of unconditional devotion. The downcast gaze (frame 3), intensified by blushing and complemented by a winsome dimple, may convey coyness. Weir&rsquo;s perspicacious choice of cast and his ability to use cinematic methods to highlight just the right features made Miranda an epitome of mystery and enchantment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, the secret to the mystery of Miranda&rsquo;s image created by Weir is its dualism akin to that of Da Vinci&rsquo;s Mona Lisa. In the shot, Miranda&rsquo;s fleeting smile, the playful twinkle in her eye, the gentle yet dominant demeanor leave the audience wondering if she is a pious child of God or an inadvertent seductress. Just like the allegory of Eve in the garden of Eden - did she entice or was she a victim herself? - the image of Miranda leaves the viewers wondering if she is the epitome of innocence or the embodiment of sensuality. She paradoxically represents both opposites. Not unlike Nabokov&rsquo;s Lolita, Miranda is a simultaneous combination of sexual allure and innocence, power, and vulnerability. A child with an angelic smile, Weir&rsquo;s Miranda possesses magnetism of a siren, inadvertently drawing everyone into a whirlpool of infatuation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Lindsay&rsquo;s book Mademoiselle compares Miranda to Botticelli's angel, emphasizing purity and benevolence, while in Weir&rsquo;s film, she is compared to Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, which emphasizes Miranda&rsquo;s salient sensual charisma. Surprisingly, even Botticelli's Venus seems too conservative, modest and homely compared to Miranda. Venus's piety and complaisance are replaced in Miranda with inner strength and intensity. Miranda is a different kind of heroine, the one for the tumultuous post-modern wanton world: Madonna turned femme fatale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next shot, Weir brings us into the interior of the rock. The master shot lets us see all the four characters and their environment. Surrounded by the stone, Miranda, Irma, and Marion remain cautious but become more and more at ease within the rock, as if it is their home&rsquo;s living room. The eye-level shot puts us among the girls, on their level, which lets us feel part of their group. Edith, sitting on a log, and the imposing rocks are the static part of the composition. The other girls are the dynamic part. Exhausted, Edith sits with her back to the sun as other girls move from the shade and let the sun illuminate their figures. Like a forest nymph, Miranda appears from the rock and lingers in the shade for a moment. She walks through the rocky terrain, hips swaying slightly, the belt accentuating her appealing forms, the curve in her silhouette emphasized by the contour of the mountain in the foreground. Miranda&rsquo;s body language, her hands lingering on the rock, her graceful posture, her fluid moves make her stand out among her peers as unusually mature and sumptuous. Perhaps influenced by prejudice towards less attractive people, the film bluntly juxtaposes Miranda&rsquo;s poise with Edith&rsquo;s awkward strut. The feminine, daring, exciting in Miranda is rather unfairly contrasted with the coarse, pedestrian, conventional, closed-minded, childish represented by Edith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Lindsay nor Weir let the viewer into Miranda&rsquo;s inner world, but we witness her utter some esoteric, ostensibly profound remarks which seem to contain the key to the riddle of disappearance: &ldquo;Everything begins and ends at exactly the right time and place.&rdquo; But it is more through her pensive gaze, her lingering observations of the surroundings that the viewers are lead to believe that she possesses some arcane intuitive truth that only she knows. Miranda sees beyond what can be seen. In a Stockholm syndrome kind of way, she becomes possessed by the undefinable force. Like Alice in Wonderland, she ventures into the unknown, following the call of the Rock. Like Ariadne, she leads the girls through the labyrinth of stone further into the foreign uncharted land.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In crafting his image of Miranda, Weir drew inspiration from Pre-Raphaelite art. Yet, Miranda is a different kind of Pre-Raphaelite girl compared to Sarah. With her &ldquo;secret pain in the absurdly large eyes&rdquo; (Ch 9, Paragraph 12), Sarah, reminiscent of Virginia Woolf, is a tragic character, evincing the air of romantic melancholy. Although she doesn&rsquo;t possess Miranda&rsquo;s angelic qualities, Sarah&rsquo;s innocence and unaffectedness are more pronounced, and there are no allusions to sensuality. Miranda&rsquo;s particular type of beauty also contrasts sharply with that of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s, whose countenance is an emblem of kindness, virtue, and charm without ambiguity or suggestiveness.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, one problem with the film is its narrow, rather conventional, even biased definition of beauty. In his interview, Wier specifically talks about the challenges of finding that particular refined, elegant Victorian look that was so specific, that only girls from Adelaide could fit the bill. Weir succeeded in casting someone who brought this extra-dimension of tempting allure to Miranda&rsquo;s character, which may have contributed to the unprecedented success of the film.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The image that Weir chose for us to represent Miranda may shed some light on our tastes, perceptions, and preferences as a society. It can make us think about femininity, how we perceive it, how the notion of the feminine has changed throughout ages, and how it is represented in today&rsquo;s art. Weir&rsquo;s cinematic portrayal of Miranda can make us wonder how our social conditioning predisposes us to interpret characters in a certain way. However idealized and one-dimensional, Miranda&rsquo;s character may generate a rainbow of reactions. On the emotional level, we may build allegiance with her, feel attracted to her or perhaps feel jealous and threatened - like I was - by her ability to &ldquo;hypnotize&rdquo; men. But on the aesthetic level, Miranda&rsquo;s image is a representation of what our society unanimously finds enticing and dangerously fascinating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the shots and throughout the film Weir succeeds in developing Lindsay&rsquo;s tenuous sketch of Miranda into a character of captivating power and magnetism. Using the lighting, camera angle, composition, music, dialogue, body motions, facial expressions, and editing he creates a compelling image of a beguiling woman whose grace, sophistication, mystery and dainty charm continue to perplex and mesmerize.&nbsp;</span></p>
