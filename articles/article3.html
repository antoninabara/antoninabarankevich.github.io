    <h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; La Raza by Frost</h1>
<p>The musical track of &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; is laid-back and &ldquo;suave&rdquo; thanks to its moderate tempo and smooth saxophone inviting to groove and lounge. The song&rsquo;s message is self-affirming and powerful. Behind the self-righteous machismo and images of guns, there is a need for empowerment and respect. According to Oliver Wang, &ldquo;Frost&rsquo;s use of hip hop as a vehicle to deliver his Chicano pride manifesto affirms identity while simultaneously bridging communities.&rdquo; Sampling &ldquo;Viva Tirado&rdquo; reveals the long history of alliances between Latino and African-American musicians. Although there have been tensions possibly perpetrated by the government, both communities have struggled through similar hazards like discrimination and structural violence. According to Oliver Wang, &ldquo;Viva Tirado&rdquo; was an anthem to the Chicano movement, while Frost&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; became a hymn of his generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One source of the song&rsquo;s force is in its title and in the most dominant word &ldquo;la Raza&rdquo;. It is serendipitous that the word &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; with its rolling &ldquo;erre&rdquo; and the buzzing [s], is itself sharp and heavy. When Kid Frost enunciates it, &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; produces a soundwave that cuts through the air like a razor blade of a machete.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Juggling two languages requires extra versatility. The way a person belonging to two cultures balances languages may indicate the degree to which these cultures dominate their mind. In &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; Kid Frost mixes and rhymes English and Spanish creating his personal version of calo. It is interesting how sometimes he chooses to use English grammatical features to frame Spanish words:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruising in the calle, headed for the bolo</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican-Americans who came from Mexico might prefer to say &ldquo;Cruising en la calle, headed por el bolo&rdquo;, using Spanish articles and preposition since they also perfectly fit into the rhythm. Mexican-Americans who were born in the US might be more comfortable using English grammar with the Spanish vocabulary. Hybrid languages like calo are particularly flexible, non-conformist and very individual. Being rightful heirs of both American and Mexican cultures, Chicanos draw from both languages to create their unique version of the dialect.</span></p>
