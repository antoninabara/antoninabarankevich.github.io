<h1>Senegal&rsquo;s road to democratization</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senegal is an exceptional case because at the time of independence it already had a competent leader L&eacute;opold S&eacute;dar Senghor who unified and strengthened the nation while productively collaborating with France. Senghor was deeply involved in the independence movement and is one of the founding fathers of African independence. Long before he became the president, he was highly active in Senegal&rsquo;s politics. But apart from his political career, he was also an acclaimed academic, poet and philosopher. He might be a rare real-life example of an idealized philosopher-kind described in Plato&rsquo;s &ldquo;Republic&rdquo;. Senghor has found a perfect recipe for the growth of a country &ndash; a combination of strong leadership with certain social freedoms. The strong leadership ensured centralization and coordination of all political activities which unified the country. At the same time, the government allowed some political freedoms and competitive elections used as a &ldquo;safety valve&rdquo; to contain the opposition. At the same time, Senghor had to use some authoritarian methods to secure his position as a sole leader.[1]&nbsp;He became president by winning the elections in 1960. However, the country also had Prime Minister Mamadou Dia who was supposed to be in charge of executing Senghor&rsquo;s development plan. In 1962, Senghor ordered to arrest Dia and kept him in prison for 12 years. Thus, Senghor eliminated the possibility of a coup. In part thanks to some control over the opposition, throughout history, Senegal has never had a coup and all transitions of power were peaceful. Thus, after independence, Senegal was ruled by a relatively democratic regime. However, political power was tightly consolidated in the hands of one-party and the president. Senghor was a wise leader who promoted Senegal&rsquo;s steady development. Yet in the beginning, his regime had to carefully curb the opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&shy;&shy;&shy;According to Cheeseman, after 1966 Sengor&rsquo;s party dominance was really strong, so he did not have to worry about losing power. This means that he did not have to waste resources on suppressing competition. When the citizens were about to protest, Senghor would implement reforms instead of repressions. Cheeseman calls this regime &ldquo;controlled political liberalization&rdquo;.[2]&shy; During the 1970s, Senegal transitioned to a three-party system with the president&rsquo;s UPS party in charge. The government retained control over other parties&rsquo; agendas. It also excluded stronger rival parties like the National Democratic Rally. In 1981, Senghor stepped down and peacefully promoted his prime minister Abdou Diouf to the post of president.[3]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second wave of democratization, Senegal continued to balance one-party dominance with the multiparty system. The opposing parties were advocating for the rotation of power prompting the ruling party to implement reforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheeseman defines Senegal&rsquo;s transition to the multi-party system as &ldquo;transition from above&rdquo;. This means that the government implemented reforms in order to appease the opposition and reduce dissatisfaction. Senghor and his successor had a strong grip on power and were not afraid to allow some competition, because they knew they would still win the elections.[4]&nbsp;Thus, similar to the 1960s, in the 1970s, Senegal has been a dominant-party state in which incumbent presidents kept ruling for many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s Diouf&rsquo;s government managed the media which allowed him to promote his policies. This inspired more protests from the opposition and in the 1990s the government was forced to introduce more reforms. The changes allowed more political freedoms and competition, eventually leading to more democracy.[5]&nbsp;Thanks to the &ldquo;virtuous cycle of reforms and opposition gains&rdquo;, Senegal&rsquo;s political system has become more open leading to truly transparent elections in 2000. For the first time, the incumbent party lost its dominance, opening the way to a new government. Thus, during the &ldquo;Second Wave&rdquo; of democratization, thanks to the gradual democratization of the elections, Senegal has transitioned to a more liberal multi-party system.</p>
