<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance of form and meaning as a path towards independence</h1>
<p>in &ldquo;Our Sister Killjoy&rdquo; by Ata Aidoo</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Our Sister Killjoy</em> there are two opposing forces expressed through form: the prose representing the rational, sequential, balanced, leveled, and the poetry representing the visceral, unconscious, deep, unruly, raw, unspoken, but essential and powerful. The poetry is like the outburst of hidden anxieties, like a revelation of truth that had been kept secret. On the surface, we read the logical, censored, polite narrative. By contrast, the poetry is emotional, loud, expressive, and exasperated. It is a dance between prose and poetry: the organized, grammatically correct, structured, proper narrative and the broken, syncopated, formless, musical, rhythmic, dynamic flow of consciousness saturated with meaning. This makes &ldquo;Our Sister Killjoy a perfect case-study for formalist analysis, but beyond the linguistic merit, the novel makes a political statement. The literary juxtaposition of prose and poetry reflects the socio-cultural struggle between the dominating continent and its straining, aching counterpart. This struggle is represented in the journey of a young woman in her search for identity, independence, understanding, and justice.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Heresy of a Paraphrase&rdquo;, Brooks states that &ldquo;[t]he structure meant is certainly not form in the conventional sense in which we think of form as a kind of envelope that &lsquo;contains&rsquo; the content&rdquo; (Brooks, 178). In &ldquo;Our Sister Killjoy&rdquo;, the form is not something external, it is essential to and inseparable from the meaning. The ingenuity of &ldquo;Our Sister Killjoy&rdquo; is in putting prose next to poetry and letting the reader observe how these two forms transmit meaning, producing very different effects. Brooks emphasizes the importance of unity of stylistic means with the meaning to produce the tension and &ldquo;dramatic force&rdquo; (footnote 188-9). The poetry in &ldquo;Our Sister&rdquo; does exactly that.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of prose and poetry establishes an uncanny binary of oppositions: prose mediated by logic, filtered through the censorship of reason represents the European, traditional, proper, conformed. The poetry, driven by emotion and passion represents the African, authentic, and expressive. The free-form poetry is like the free spirit of Africa trying to break through the rigidity of European constraining tradition. Not every poetry is free from conventions. But Ata Aidoo chooses the free-form poetry that doesn&rsquo;t conform to rhyme but rather lets the rhythm break through the page and like a wave carry the meaning along. The poetry in &ldquo;Sister Killjoy&rdquo; echoes spoken word or rap, it uses broken nominative phrases without predicates and run-on sentences. In prose, the meaning is constrained within the rigid quarters of sentence structure. In poetry, there is a free play between the meaning and the form, in which meaning begets form and form produces meaning.</p>
<p>Thus, &ldquo;Our Sister Killjoy&rdquo; is a perfect case study of the power of literary narrative. The poetry here is potent with energy. In poetry, words acquire extra weight, they gain performative power, they penetrate the reader&rsquo;s mind. Thanks to the rhythm, the words are like a mountain stream that transports meaning with speed and force and carries you along, at times overwhelming you with signification. The poetic means of style such as rhythm and rhyme unite to produce an explosive impact. So, the prose is like the placid transparent surface of the water, and the poetry is like the undercurrent, the riptide that sweeps you away and floods you with meaning. Poetry lets the unspoken transpire. It is like purging the anxieties that haunt you.</p>
<p>Aidoo also uses concrete poetry, where the sign is not only a linguistic signifier corresponding to an idea in our heads but also a visual representation of the signified:</p>
<p>&ldquo;L</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>N</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>L</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>N</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>Forever falling like a tear out of a woman&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo; (65)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here each letter sliding down the page represents a tear, visually reminiscent of a teardrop falling down a cheek.</p>
<p>Beyond its poetry&rsquo;s unconventional form, &ldquo;Our Sister&rdquo; is full of surprises on the lexical level. It is a paragon of estrangement. In &ldquo;Art as Device&rdquo; Shklovsky declared that &ldquo;the purpose of imagery is to bring significance of the image closer to our understandin<u>g&rdquo; (1).</u> It is through the choice of words that familiar becomes unusual and the reader is prompted to see things in the new light. In the poetic part of &ldquo;Our Sister&rdquo; there are many mysteries that succeed at defamiliarization. First, they baffle and confuse, but with some mental effort and perseverance, they can reveal their meanings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At nine a <strong>showpiece</strong></p>
<p>At eighteen a <strong>darling</strong></p>
<p>What shall you be</p>
<p>At thirty?</p>
<p>A <strong>dog</strong> among the masters, <u>the</u></p>
<p>Most masterly of the dogs. (42)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two lines make it clear that the piece deals with the unfair treatment of women. But it is not easy to interpret the second part because of the figurative language. By breaking the routine of prose where things are usually called by their direct names, in poetry, metaphors make the reader stumble and pause. Slowly the reader can deduct first the overall negative feel of the phrase. The woman is compared to a dog implying her insignificant status as almost a non-human. &ldquo;[T]he Most masterly of the dogs&rdquo; is a more polysemic phrase that requires a deeper analysis. This metaphor may correspond to the necessity of the oppressed to conform to the rules of the oppressor, the strategy that helps integration and assimilation, but involves resignation of one&rsquo;s principles and pretending that the past does not exist. In &ldquo;Our Sister&rdquo; this conformity is represented by the other African man whom Sissy met at the event. He seems to have chosen the easier path of conformity. He plays by the oppressor's rules, adopts the oppressor's ways of communication and acts within the norms established by the oppressors.</p>
<p>Shklovsky states that &ldquo;... in order to return sensation to our limbs, in order to make us feel objects, to make a stone stony, man has been given the tool of art. The purpose of art, then, is to lead us to a knowledge of a thing through the organ of sight instead of recognition.&rdquo; By &ldquo;estranging&rdquo; objects and complicating form, the device of art makes perception long and &ldquo;laborious&rdquo; (6). &ldquo;Our Sister&rdquo; is an epitome of &ldquo;estranging objects&rdquo; and &ldquo;complicating form&rdquo;. A complex layered estrangement through defamiliarization happens on page 39:</p>

<p>The only way to end up a <strong>cultural </strong></p>
<p><strong>Vulture </strong></p>
<p>Is to <strong>feed on carrion</strong> all the way</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can not achieve <u>the</u></p>
<p><strong>Moribund</strong> objectives <u>of a</u></p>
<p>Dangerous education by using</p>
<p>Living forces.</p>
<p>Therefore, since</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Ghosts</strong> know their numbers,&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Intellectual Stillborn</strong></p>
<p>with perfect reason -</p>
<p>Can Break his neck to recruit</p>
<p><strong>Academic corpses</strong> from Europe. (39, my emphasis)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This piece requires close analysis and debate in order to discern its meanings. But even without revealing its signification, the verse produces a strong effect. &ldquo;A cultural vulture&rdquo;, &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dr. Intellectual Stillborn&rdquo;, &ldquo;Academic corpses&rdquo; are descriptive metaphors that first shock and perplex. On a closer examination, it may be deduced that these words define instigators of the Eurocentric education, which deprives Africans of their authentic heritage. &ldquo;Academic corpses&rdquo; are imported from Europe to impose their &ldquo;moribund&rdquo; education, hijacking African identity. Thus, a commentary on the corrupted nature of education in Africa is elevated to a riddle that makes you feel anger towards the absurdity of the injustice.</p>
<p>In Aidoo&rsquo;s verses, there are numerous &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; articles and prepositions at the end of lines. It is as if the author wants to leave them behind as something redundant. Placing the articles that do not carry meaning at the end of lines, and putting the meaning-carrying words in the first positions, emphasizes the importance of the adjectives and nouns that are the actual carriers of meaning. It is as if the poetry is trying to bring more attention to the essential represented by nouns and adjectives, ignoring the particles.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Art as Device&rdquo; Shklovsky emphasizes the economy of means as one of the advantages of poetry: &ldquo;Poetry is a special mode of thinking &ndash; to be precise, a mode of thinking in images. This mode entails a certain economy of effort that makes us &ldquo;feel the relative ease of the process. The aesthetic sense is a consequence of this economy&rdquo; (1). &nbsp;Indeed, poetry expresses a lot with few means, packing multitudes within few words. Its emotionally charged phrases dense with meaning and feeling make us get the message faster.</p>

<p>West Berlin</p>
<p>As loud <u>as a</u></p>
<p><strong>Self-conscious whore</strong> <strong><u>at a</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Gay last-night party</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aboard a sinking ship</strong></p>
<p>East Berlin,</p>
<p>Quiet like a <strong>haunted house</strong></p>
<p>On a Sunday afternoon. (59, my emphasis)</p>
<p>This verse is distinct because it succeeds at estrangement, but it is not as laborious as the previous examples. The difference may lie in the use of comparison in place of metaphors. The comparisons here provide a more direct way to conjure images associated with the object without stretching our associative skills too far. Comparisons are closer to the objects they define and make it easier for the reader to transfer their qualities onto the object. While other examples are poetic but laborious because they radically defamiliarize to the point of confusion, in the above example, the estrangement creates clear images that facilitate understanding. At the same time, the above comparisons are Eurocentric, because they utilize the images that are part of European Zeitgeist and may be unfamiliar to a non-westerner. In the age of globalization, most of the people are acquainted with western references due to the diffusion of cultural knowledge, but it still may be biased to expect everyone to read this comparison with ease.</p>
<p>The function of poetry in &ldquo;Our Sister Killjoy&rdquo; is akin to the chorus in the Greek tragedy. It is like the lucid commentary on the events that reveal the hidden meaning of what is going on. The prose deals with reality, with the surface of things and with the events as they unfold. The poetry exposes the inner layers of meaning, connecting the present to the history of abuse and misrepresentation.</p>
<p>The prose and poetry&rsquo;s dialectic within the piece is like a battle between two forces. Poetry, like blades of grass, is springing up and making its way through the asphalt of prose. Perhaps this dichotomy represents Sissy&rsquo;s double identity: her persona that has to be polite, respectful, even grateful versus her conscious self-identity with her uneasy feelings about the outside world and the foreign society which she has to navigate. On the metaphorical level, the ideas expressed via poetry are like her subconscious connected to the collective subconscious of her nation and the whole African continent. These ideas are part of her without her fully realising it. They are in her DNA, inherited through generations of history of struggle, subjugation, and discrimination.</p>
<p>It is not possible to determine with certainty the source of these ideas in the story. The narrator can be an avatar of the author, or an ominous being representing the collective consciousness of the African nations, or a future more mature Sissy. The narrator refers to Sissy as &ldquo;Our sister&rdquo;, using the plural possessive pronoun which suggests that the speaker is actually a group of people. The ideas in the poetry support and align with Sissy&rsquo;s own feelings and opinions, but they may be too universal, eloquent, and profound to belong to a young person. Sissy is already fairly mature, highly self-aware, and aware of the cause and effect relationship between Europe and Africa, but she is still on the path of discovering all the intricacies of post-colonial power dynamics. Either and all of these narrator scenarios are possible. This ambiguity provides for multiple interpretations and makes it possible to read the novel from many different perspectives, thus expanding the scope of its meaning.</p>
<p>The rules of prose, like the rules of the society, require one to follow conventions. In prose, one must adhere to the syntactic hierarchy, follow the word order, agree the subject with predicate, and conjugate correctly. In poetry, one can declare anarchy and break the hierarchy. Achebe is aware that English was imposed on African nations, but he gives credit to English for serving as a means of communication among the many nations in Africa. Yet, he is against English dictating its rules to its users: &ldquo;The price a world language must be prepared to pay is submission to different kinds of use.&rdquo; Achebe wants English to adjust, to bend, to submit to the needs of its speakers. He wants Africans to adapt English to their needs, to express their reality, instead of submitting to the Anglophone linguistic hegemony. While in prose it is harder to avoid the rigid hierarchy of language, in poetry, this structural linguistic prison can be broken and adjusted to express the realities specific to the speaker. In &ldquo;Imperialism of Language&rdquo; Ngugi argues that &ldquo;[a]n oppressor language inevitably carries racist and negative images of the conquered nation, particularly in its literature, and English is no exception&rdquo; (35). &ldquo;Our sister Killjoy&rdquo; also deals with the problem of using the language of the invader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English - a</p>
<p>Doubtful weapon fashioned</p>
<p>Elsewhere to give might to a</p>
<p>Soul that is already</p>
<p>Fled.&rdquo; (29)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The novel &ldquo;bends&rdquo; the language, adjusts it to represent a different kind of voice.</p>
<p>The verse highlights the incongruence between English and the reality that it has to represent. English cannot express the African soul, because its linguistic means are not enough. Audre Lorde criticized feminism focused on the white heterosexual female in her text &ldquo;The Master&rsquo;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&rsquo;s House&rdquo;. The idea in the title in its more universal sense can be applied to the use of language. It is a tragedy and an irony that deprived of their own language, African nations were left no other option but to use the language of the oppressor to express themselves. It is hard to reclaim independence, authority, and cultural and political self-identity using the language that was used as a weapon against you.</p>
<p>As it develops at the intersection of form and meaning, of prose and poetry, the novel depicts the reality of a woman at the intersection of Europe and Africa, at the crossroads of feminist and postcolonial problematics. Sissy is a new type of protagonist, emancipated, opinionated, skeptical, politically aware, representing a different image of Africa, strong and independent, aware of its history and identity. With poetic means, Aidoo manages to pack a lot into her short novel. Through the eyes of a girl in the midst of a skewed world, we get to see the uneasy relationships between the former master nation and its objectified counterpart. Through the dichotomy of poetry and prose, the novel talks about the continual injustices of neocolonialism, the anxieties due to power imbalance, the social, historical, cultural, and gender relationships within the post-colonial context. With the power of poetry, the novel makes you not only understand and see but also feel and taste the reality and struggle of Africa to claim its identity in the neocolonial age.</p>
