    <h1>Lauryn Hill&rsquo;s work as the consciousness of hip-hop</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many icons of female empowerment among hip-hop artists. There is explicitly sexy power of Nicki Minaj. There is sassy classy power of Missy Elliott. Then there is the conscious power of Lauren Hill. In times of trouble, which never cease for the African-American community, Lauren&rsquo;s message comes speaking words of wisdom. Her songs are a force for good, a force for change, and a wake-up call for all of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Final Hour&rdquo; is a rare hip-hop song that uses an original beat without samples. The first bars are gentle and melancholic. They do not have the upfront &ldquo;in-your-fa&shy;ce&rdquo; attitude of a typical hip-hop song. It starts on a minor chord setting a somber, lyrical mood. First, the guitar&rsquo;s simple strumming creates the rhythm. Then, the beat jumps in accompanied by a flute, an unexpected combo in a rap song. The flute&rsquo;s tune frolics around in juxtaposition to the regularity of the beat. The acoustic beginning of the song sets up the mood for a candid conversation. This gentle prelude sounds intimate, inviting to listen closer. Hill&rsquo;s voice comes in bold and strong. The flute disappears for a few bars and then returns again, like a meandering stream that runs along your path, then turns in another direction out of sight only to catch up with you later. The guitar&rsquo;s strumming persists without changing the chord, acting like a rhythmic pendulum supporting the drum. At the ends of phrases, the voice begins splitting into harmony. When Hill starts talking about money, a playful saxophone turns the melancholy song jazzy and upbeat. At 1:40, a brisk arpeggio of a harp splashes like a sparkling wave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the poetic level, the song has intricate inside rhymes and profuse wordplay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <strong>introduce</strong> then <strong>produce, </strong>words so <strong>profuse</strong></p>
<p>It's <strong>abuse</strong> how <strong>I juice</strong> up this beat, like I'm <strong>deuce</strong>,</p>
<p>two people both equal&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill confidently declares her power. She is self-aware and deliberate in her intent to express something important, necessary, of value, to be the voice of a generation. With her rap, she writes a thesis about the life of the streets, for the people of the streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads<br /> <a href="https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-final-hour-lyrics#note-1772446">While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill is upfront in her accusations. She exposes the complacency and indifference of the carefree whites. Her serious message clashes with the man&rsquo;s trivial preoccupation with banal things like food or clothes. While others crave money, Hill craves justice. She is on a mission to expose and bust the system of violence that keeps putting down her community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get the money<br /> You can get the power<br /> But keep your eyes on the Final Hour&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The singer reproaches the big-headed white supremacists and she professes revenge for their indifference and complacency. More specifically &ldquo;you&rdquo; can represent white corporate America, materialistic elites, people who do not care, or are blind to the racial injustice going on around them. Hill is a rebel prophet rapping against structural violence. In contrast to Nicki Menaj or Missy Eliott Hill who use a lot of humor in their work and don&rsquo;t seem to take themselves too seriously, Hill is all about fighting for people&rsquo;s rights. Juggling aptly slanted rhymes, Hill sings about reversing the injustice:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a slum lord <strong>be the tenant</strong> give his money to kids <strong>to spend it</strong><br /> And then <strong>amend it</strong>, every law that ever <strong>prevented</strong><br /> Our <strong>survival</strong> since our <strong>arrival</strong>&nbsp;documented in <strong>The Bible</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill talks about laws that represent the structural violence, embedding racism into the very texture of the American legal system. She bends language to fit her flow, rhyming &ldquo;Lauren Hill&rdquo; with &ldquo;IsraEEl&rdquo;. She makes words malleable, flexible like hot metal. Through her emphatic enunciation Hill asserts herself with determination and force. She stands empowered and talks down to the abusers. One source of her confidence is her faith. She alludes to the Bible and the main refrain mentions the &ldquo;final hour&rdquo; which may refer to the judgment day. Hill relies on religion as the source of her words&rsquo; legitimacy. Her spirituality is multi-dimensional and philosophical. She recalls the Bible but she also alludes to Islam. Another source of Hill&rsquo;s power is in her stellar record. Throughout the song she refers to her previous work, presenting her popularity and accolades as proof of her legitimacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill rhymes as she breathes and she has fun with it coming up with quirky tongue-twisting combos. Her &ldquo;mozzarella&rdquo; could be foreshadowing Rhiana&rsquo;s 2007 hit &ldquo;Umbrella&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I'm a get the <strong>mozzarella</strong> like a <strong>Rockerfeller</strong><br /> Still be in the church of <strong>Lalibela</strong>, singing hymns a cappella<br /> Whether posed in <strong>Maribella</strong> in Couture<br /> Or collecting residuals from off <strong>The Score</strong><br /> I'm making sure I'm with the <strong>144</strong><br /> I've been here <strong>before</strong> this ain't a battle, this is <strong>war&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill&rsquo;s rhymes fall down like cascades of The Niagara Falls, they shoot like mental bullets hitting the target.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Final Hour&rdquo; is not explicitly about feminist issues. It is about racial injustice and Hill&rsquo;s determination to fight it. Yet, Hill&rsquo;s art as well as her self-empowered persona unequivocally position her as the epitome of feminism. Through her songs, she expresses a range of affect which bare open quintessentially female sensibilities. As she is standing up for herself, her community, and anyone oppressed by the injustice she sets the real foundation for the modern Me-Too Movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All female hip-hop artists speak their truth and all of their voices - from the most sensual to the most robust - are important for expressing the universe of female experiences and identities. Among many artists, Hill stands aside, more precisely, she stands above, as the ultimate artist-social-justice-fighter. She has plenty of sass and plenty of natural sexy - she can&rsquo;t help it. She also proves her true strength by sharing her feelings and vulnerabilities. But she stays focused on the essential - her moral message.</p>
<p>According to the Black Feminism blog, &ldquo;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&rdquo; is very universal in its lessons, themes, and teachings&rdquo;. Yet, it a quintessentially an African-American opus. It specifically portrays the experiences of an African-American woman, so blatantly ignored by the second-wave feminism. It expresses the turmoil of humans positioned at the intersection of race and gender which makes them more vulnerable to pervasive structural violence. &ldquo;Instead of feeling like she has to censor who she is to be accepted by the masses, she instead seems to find pleasure in everything that she is as a black woman and dares anyone to challenge her stance&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from her singing career, Hill is also an acclaimed thespian and a television actor. She loves sports, music, arts and has pursued many interests throughout her life. On a personal level, Hill may contain several identities which she channels into her songs. She is primarily a social justice fighter, but also a mother, a philanthropist, a woman suffering from betrayal, or getting revenge or fighting for love. Her music contains a wide range of affect which she expresses with a number of vocal techniques seamlessly fusing genres from R&amp;B and reggae to soul and gospel and funk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her chapter &ldquo;The Venus Hip Hop and the pink ghetto&rdquo;, Imani Perry talks about an archetype of a "badwoman", a rebel who is fed up with the misogyny, someone who fights back and puts men in their place be it with her words or a gun. A bad woman is independent, violent, and dangerous. These "badwomen" contrast with artists like Beyonc&eacute; or more worldly icons like Michelle Obama who may represent &ldquo;goodwomen&rdquo;. They also fight, but they play by the rules. The two types may correspond to the archetypes of the queen of spades and the queen of hearts. Lauren Hill can be both. She has the drive and force of a "badwoman", but at the same time, her message is focused on the important issues. Both these identities are instrumental in disrupting the systems of patriarchy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the essence of Hill&rsquo;s capacity for wisdom and compassion is revealed when she speaks about her broken heart. She talks about the person who hurt her continuously with the empathy of a mother. In her 2000 interview<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, she explains that while she grew up in a loving family her partner had a troubled childhood that left him with a deep void. To explain her partner&rsquo;s inability, she uses the metaphor of a dark deep hole that could not be healed. She sees the underlying causes of people&rsquo;s behavior. Nevertheless, in her song &ldquo;Lost Ones&rdquo;, she reclaims her power pushing back and putting someone in his place. In hip hop, like in life, a woman has to walk the fine line between love and hurt &ldquo;combining feelings of self-empowerment with self-defense&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her interview, Lauren explains that &ldquo;Miseducation&rdquo; was a result of her deep emotional turmoil experienced in a painful relationship. All the songs came naturally after she went through a prolonged psychological trauma due to rejection. This deep anxiety finally resolved and she found clarity and gained insight that naturally was channeled into her songs. As a result, the album expresses an incredible range of human affect to which many females can relate. Perhaps, that is why this album means so much to many women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lauren Hill&rsquo;s image and persona go in harmony with her message. She is outspoken and emphatic about social injustice. She readily shares her philosophy and talks about the genesis of her values and believes. She walks the talk. Perhaps, one unbiased way to get to know someone as a person is to hear what their children say about them. In her interview<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, Lauren&rsquo; Hill&rsquo;s daughter Selah Marley reveals the essential. A minute is enough to see how unaffected and genuine she is regardless of her career as a model. She credits her mother with instilling in her belief in herself and really giving her the right tools to navigate the precarious life of a celebrity&rsquo;s child. Like her mother, Selah is open, charismatic, and full of insights. She admits she is also prone to vulnerability. But foremost, she is herself, unpretentious, and open-hearted. In the modern age, raising children the right way is a gigantic fit. Judging by her daughter&rsquo;s feedback, Hill is an engaged parent who knows how to educate and enlighten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world of female hip-hop, all roads lead back to Lauren Hill. In Ava Duveray&rsquo;s documentary about female artists<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>, MCs speak of Lauren Hill with reverence and awe. They cite her as a source of inspiration and empowerment. Surprisingly, MCs speak of her in the past tense mourning the loss of a legend while the legend is alive, and if not kicking, then happily giving talks and concerts. She might not command the charts but she still commands the minds and hearts of her devoted followers. Perhaps, a live performance where you can interact with the audience may feel more organic and fulfilling. Perhaps, the modern commercial industry is too focused on entertainment and gains for an artist with high moral standards. Perhaps, sometime taking care of your family is the best act of service one can offer to humanity. Whatever it may be, Lauren Hill&rsquo;s influence is undeniable. She remains the epitome of eloquence and the ever-lasting consciousness of hip-hop.</p>
