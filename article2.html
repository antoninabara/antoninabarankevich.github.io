<h1>&nbsp;Reshaping the image of Compton through self-expression in Kendrick Lamar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good Kid&rdquo;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout his career, Kendrick Lamar has worked primarily with three labels: Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. Kendrick is a self-made artist from Compton. He started making music in middle school and from an early age, he learned the art of music production. This experience of creating tracks himself from scratch, having control over his material taught him to be discerning and selective in music production. &ldquo;Top Dawg&rdquo; label is a creation of Anthony &ldquo;Top Dawg&rdquo; Tiffith from Watts. It is an independent label and it has released works by artists like Isaiah Rashad, ScHoolboy Q, SZA, Jay Rock, and Ab-Soul among others. The friendship between Tiffin and Lamar started in 2003 when Kendrick was 16 years old released his first mixtapes. Gradually TDE signed more and more artists. In 2012, TDE signed an agreement with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records in order to jointly release Lamar&rsquo;s album &ldquo;Good Kid M.A.A.D. City&rdquo;. The label mainly works with local Los Angeles artists from Inglewood to Carson. Kendrick and Anthony have developed a special bond. When Spotify banned the controversial music of XXXTentation, both Lamar and Tiffin united against Spotify defending Hip Hop artists' right to express without being censored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to billboar.com, &ldquo;TDE now provides the model for how to balance artistic integrity and massive commercial success&rdquo;. It also has a taste for &ldquo;cerebral&rdquo; artists that complement their flow and beats with messages that move and open your mind. Lamar says he thinks of TDE as a family and is grateful for the guidance he received from the label. Tiffith&rsquo;s approach from the start was to groom the kids from troubled neighborhoods and make them work hard so they can reach success. Having been through tough times himself, he wanted to show the kids a different way to live by helping them develop their creativity. For his inspiration, Tiffin credits his uncle - a gangster who became a community activist and made a song &ldquo;We are all from the same gang.&rdquo; The work done in Tiffin&rsquo;s studio turned Lamar into a budding artist and gave him a professional foundation and confidence to make it in the industry. During this time Lamar has developed self-awareness and started seeing himself as an artist who has a lot to share. He has converted his childhood experiences, the violence, injustice, and tragedy that he saw into a set of stories that later became &ldquo;Good Kid M.A.A.D. City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kendrick is quintessentially an LA artist. He has a strong sense of belonging to his community in Compton and it transpires in his lyrics. His mesmerizing song &ldquo;The Recipe&rdquo; accurately describes the motivations of why many people come to LA: &ldquo;women, weed and weather&rdquo;, while his songs &ldquo;Compton&rdquo; and &ldquo;M.A.A.D City&rdquo; paint scenes of violence he witnessed growing up. The documentary &ldquo;Noisey Bompton&rdquo; shows Kendrick among his friends in Compton. In an interview, he tells how he is rethinking the community, and with his songs he shapes a different image of Compton breaking prejudice, opening up different dimensions of the everyday life of his community. He says his goal is to do something different. In &ldquo;King Kunta&rdquo; Kendrick sings: &ldquo;You sabotaged my community, making a killing, you made me a killer, emancipation of a real n&hellip;.&rdquo;. Kendrick&rsquo;s music and his message are making people rethink gang life. He wants to destroy stereotypes by telling his story and others&rsquo; stories. At the same time, he wants to &ldquo;spark the idea of positivity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kendrick is very attentive to his process; he devotes a lot of time crafting his songs. He constantly takes notes of his ideas for hooks. In the studio, he searches for a particular sound that can trigger the emotion he experienced months ago. In the interview with Rick Rubin, Lamar says he constantly challenges himself, does not compromise and does not get comfortable in his own skin. He finds a way to say harsh things that society doesn&rsquo;t want to hear, while still maintaining the connection through music. In his songs, he shares his journey, his past, and the way he was raised by &ldquo;a father a complete realist in the streets, mother a dreamer&rdquo; who represents the yin and the yang in him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On stage, Lamar is striving to create an exclusive experience for his audiences. He thoroughly rehearses finding new surprising sounds suitable for the concert environment. He is also aware of his mannerisms, his body movement, and especially of the tembre of his voice. Getting inspiration from Prince, he pays a lot of attention to the range of his vocals. In his interviews, Lamar is simple, humble, thoughtful, eloquent, and endlessly charismatic. He does not smoke and is not into drinking. A lot of his sensibilities might be coming from his loneliness he experienced in his childhood even though he had trusted friends. As a teenager, he had to lose a lot of close people to gang violence and police brutality and it affected him for life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His album &ldquo;Good Kid M.A.A.D. City&rdquo; is a collection of stories that show lives in the streets of Compton. Like all of Lamar&rsquo;s work, the songs are earnest and full of affect. Some songs are about life and death in the streets, others are personal revelations. Lamar is self-aware and introspective. In his songs he meditates on human nature, revealing his internal struggle to remain himself as he navigated the corrupting world of show business. In his songs &ldquo;Black Boy Fly&rdquo; he confesses his dreams as a boy to be famous, which realized but left him empty and unhappy. In &ldquo;Good Kid&rdquo; he shows how the system destroys people&rsquo;s aspirations criminalizing them and locking them in prison. Even after he reached success and respect, Lamar is struggling to save himself from the industry that wants him to be a certain way, squeezing him in the box of a gangster stereotype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The album was produced in collaboration with Dr. Dre, Jack Splash, Just Blaze, Hit-Boy, Scoop DeVille, and Pharrell Williams among others. There are a lot of arguments about the nature of the album&rsquo;s style and whether it has the west-coast sound. Many like to compare it with the music of &ldquo;Roots&rdquo;. Some do hear elements of G-funk. It is hard to assign the album to one particular style. It is eclectic and &ldquo;multi-sonic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The album is wrapped around Compton. In his review on AllMusic, Jeffries writes: &ldquo;This journey through the concrete jungle of Compton is worth taking because of the artistic richness within, plus the attraction of a whip-smart rapper flying high during his rookie season. Any hesitation about the horror of it all is quickly wiped away by Kendrick's mix of true talk, open heart, open mind, and an extended hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The song &ldquo;Good Kid&rdquo; from the album was written in collaboration with Pharrell Williams and mixed by Dr. Dre and Ali. The agitated high head ushers in the beat together with the alarming oboe wail that opens for the voice. &ldquo;Good kid&rdquo; features a phenomenal flow that seamlessly flies across the song carrying you along like a wave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lamar&rsquo;s songs are often very avant-garde. They are symbolic arrangements of samples, sounds, audio tracks that tease your mind like a puzzle to be solved. All the while they draw you in with their magnetic harmonies that frame Lamar&rsquo;s flow like a gemstone. &ldquo;Good Kid&rdquo; does not have the elaboration of other tracks, but all its elements together move and entice. The beat intertwines with the base. &ldquo;Good kid&rdquo; is perfectly stitched together. It has the beat, the flow, and the harmony that stir you up. They make you tick. They make you fall in love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass hallucination baby</p>
<p>Ill education baby</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two lines are pronounced on the same note except for one interval on the &ldquo;-ation&rdquo;. They are sung on the F minor chord. Then at the stroke of chimes B flat minor chord brings in a futile hope of reconnecting with your elations. Then there is a jump into C major and return to F minor:</p>
<p>Want to reconnect with your elations?</p>
<p>This is your station baby</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look inside <em><em>these walls</em></em> and you see them having <em><em>with1drawals</em></em></p>
<p>Of a prisoner on <u>his way</u></p>
<p>Trapped inside your <strong><strong>desire</strong></strong></p>
<p>To <strong><strong>fire </strong></strong>bullets that <u>stray</u></p>
<p>Track <strong><strong>attire</strong></strong> just tell you <strong><strong>I'm tired</strong></strong> and ran <strong><strong>away</strong></strong></p>
<p>I should ask <strong><strong>a choir</strong></strong>, "What do you <strong><strong>requir</strong></strong>e</p>
<p>To sing a song that <strong><strong>acquire</strong></strong> me to have faith?"</p>
<p>As the record spin I should <u>pray</u></p>
<p>For the record I recognize that I'm easily <u>prey</u></p>
<p>I got ate alive <u>yesterday</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lamar&rsquo;s rhymes are effortless as they are breathtaking. As if sawing with a needle he carries a thread of inside rhymes throughout the whole verse, weaving them within the lines, while starting a new thread of end rhyme, intertwining the two, creating a resonant tapestry. In fact, if you look at the rhyme pattern &ldquo;fire, attire, a choir, acquire&rdquo; and &ldquo;desire, I am tired, require&rdquo;, they form two almost perfect diagonals through the verse. This is not to say that this pattern was deliberate. But if analyzed neuro-linguistically it can provide good material to study the way a poet&rsquo;s mind works when creating rhymes. Lamar also carries the end rhyme &ldquo;his way, stray, ran away, pray, prey, day&rdquo; through the whole line. Making two rhymes at the same time is like simultaneously drawing two portraits with both hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lamar is famous for creating songs with layered, surreal arrangements that blow your mind and make you high without ever trying the drug. They are indeed, works of high art worthy of a dissertation. Like his music which is the result of the collaboration of elite musical minds, Lamar&rsquo;s lyrics should be investigated with a microscope - they contain worlds of meanings, rhymes, and metaphors living a life of their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got animosity building</p>
<p>It's probably big as a building</p>
<p>Me jumping off of the roof</p>
<p>Is just me playing it safe</p>
<p>But what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>When the topic is <strong><strong>red or blue</strong></strong></p>
<p>And you understand that I ain't</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kendrick is expressing his exasperation with the system that classifies him as criminals. He also gets political referring to the &ldquo;red and blue&rdquo; representing one party that hates his community and the other that can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time you clock in the morning</p>
<p>I feel you just want to kill</p>
<p>All my innocence while ignoring my purpose</p>
<p>To persevere as a better person</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lamar is tired of being misrepresented as a criminal and tries to stay true to his values, even when the police are ready to put him down any minute. Indeed, when society treats you worse than a cockroach, how does one stay sane and preserve integrity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I quietly hope for change</p>
<p>When violence is the rhythm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He uses his lyrics as a means to induce change and bring attention to the injustice. When the violence is the rhythm, he is creating his own beat and fights back with his words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like coffee, jazz, and conceptual art, Lamar&rsquo;s works are an acquired taste. The complexity of his arrangements requires a sensitive ear and an inquisitive mind to interpret. A lot is packed between the lines. Like an evocative time warp his songs draw you into the story. They feature samples of beats and poetry from the history of music and fuse genres and styles, creating a distinct evocative type of sound. In many songs, Lamar uses jazz elements. His synthesis of hip-hop and &ldquo;neo-jazz&rdquo; and his collaboration with Terrace Martin, Thunderstorm, and Flying Lotus in &ldquo;Damn&rdquo; give his music an unusual edge. Some even call it Compton Jazz Revival. On the perceptual level, regular chords have periods and exclamations, while jazz sevenths chords have ellipses. They make verses into rhetorical questions to ponder which go well with Lamar&rsquo;s philosophical angle. His songs are both straightforward and nuanced, self-reflective, and thought-provoking. His themes range from violence and the perils of injustice to the struggle of his community and the complexity of human nature. If the words are the flesh and the music is the soul of a song, Lamar&rsquo;s works embody a complex human nature full of spirit and heart.</p>
